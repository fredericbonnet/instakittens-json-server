# Instakittens JSON Server

This project implements a simple mock REST API server for the [Instakittens
project](https://github.com/fredericbonnet/instakittens).

It is based on the awesome [JSON
Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) package that lets you build a
fully working REST API server from a simple JSON file.

## JSON Database

The [mock database file](db.json) was generated by the companion app
[Instakittens Data
Generator](https://github.com/fredericbonnet/instakittens-data-generator).

## REST API server

Powered by [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
